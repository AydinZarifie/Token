# Token

its a first token project but its not on ERC20 standard.

the contracts will be compile  make possible to connect from web3 to smart contract.

the compile of smartcontracts are in the json files , with abi(app binary interfaces) of that smartcontract json files we can connect to smart contract from ui.

I used ganache , what is the local test blockchain on my laptop and this dapp is run on the p2p ganche network, if you want to connect to another networks
you just change the connect setting in the truffle-config.js file.
